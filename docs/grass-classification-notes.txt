code
- set up new project
- create env with conda
- add environment and requirements.txt
- install packages

Core processing:
- the core part of the code involves a few steps
 1. the code can handle two types of input
  - an image url pointing to a file stored in my storage account
  - an image file in bytes
 2. the code then sends the image to the custom vision model
 3. the model returns a prediction for areas of grass and weed in the selected image
 4. the code then returns the top n predictions to the user
    - a copy of the images is annotated (marked with rectangles) 
     with the predictions and saved in the storage account.
     - a json file is also saved with the predictions
 6. the code returns the url of the annotated image to the user


in azure portal
